# Active Window Logger #

A simple Windows (VB 2008) app to smartly log the currently active foreground window of the system. It supports trimming the entry-log and exporting it as a csv file.

One of the ideas behind writing such an application is to be develop a personal time/activity tracker back-end tool. The accompanying front-end tool - **Active Window Parser** allows one to analyse the `csv` file exported from **Active Window Logger** and prepare beautiful and insightful visualisations to highlight how time was spent on the PC. Thresults can be used to optimise for better focus and productivity.
